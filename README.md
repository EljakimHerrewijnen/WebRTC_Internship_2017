# WebRTC_Internship_2017
Project made during my internship. 

This is a .Net core based application. The application was made with the goal to make it easy for people to call other people on the application by clicking on their pictures. It runs on a Raspberry pi, wich was one of the requirements of 
the assignment.

The application is a web server which handless the users and the calls. The calls are made using WebRTC which creates a p2p line between 2 users.

The code is not clean, I do not recommend using it. The RTC connection parts might help some people.

The server worked with calls going in and out of the NAT firewall of the place where I did my internship.
